# Adonis / Vite / Inertia / Vuetify 3 / TailwindCSS Boilerplate

Based on the example in [91codes' adonis-vite repo](https://github.com/91codes/adonis-vite), this is a boilerplate setup for using AdonisJS as a backend, with Vue as a frontend using Inertia to remove the need for an API, along with Vite for compiling resources and hot reloading.

This project serves as a starter project for building web apps with [Adonis](http://adonisjs.com) as a backend, [Vue 3](http://vuejs.org) as a frontend and [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com) linking the two together without the need for an API. [Vite](http://vitejs.dev) is used to compile frontend assets.

I am indebted to [Adocasts](https://adocasts.com/lessons/adding-inertiajs-to-a-new-adonisjs-project) for their tutorial which I used to set up this boilerplate, as well as [91codes](https://github.com/91codes) Adonis-Vite setup and exampl.
